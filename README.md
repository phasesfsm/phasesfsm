# Phases FSM
Phases FSM is a finite state machine graphic designer that allows to simulate and generate code.

You can start drawing the state machine, declaring variables and connecting states. Each Origin point is one state machine, multiple state machines can live in the same document.

Test the robustness of your designs simulating the state machine step-by-step and changing the inputs.

Also you can load a predefined inputs/outputs behavior and compare results with the simulation.

Take your designs to the implementation generating the code with one click.

Create your own code generation templates, documentation and more with Cottle, or export your designs data to JSON format.
